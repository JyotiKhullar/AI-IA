- **Structured (Clean IA)** — headings, metadata, cross-links

### Test Questions
1. What do I need before enabling MFA?
2. Which role can enable MFA?
3. How do I configure SSO?
4. Why might I get a 403 after turning on MFA?
5. Is MFA part of the Security Suite?

See **Knowledge Graph → Graph Overview** for the tiny KG picture.
