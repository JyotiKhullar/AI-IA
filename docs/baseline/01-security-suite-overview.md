GatewayX has three main security pieces that fit together: MFA (multi-factor authentication), SSO (single sign-on), and roles & permissions. MFA provides stronger logins, SSO centralizes identity, roles control who can do what. They are connected across the system and you'll often jump between areas to get the full picture. To go deeper you'd look into enabling MFA, setting up SSO, and how roles work. test
